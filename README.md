# dotfiles for Benjamin Miller
My dotfiles. They aren't super exicting, but they're mine :)

## Acknowledgements
I wouldn't have the great QoL changes without some assitance
from the internet and from a couple of people:
- Dr. Andrew R. Dalton
- Tim Bielawa

If I missed a citation, please please pleas let me know. I
fully intend to give everyone credit where its due; but it's
possible I missed some.
